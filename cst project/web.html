<p align="center" color="green">BakeForUs Bakery is committed to facilitating the accessibility and usability of its website for all people with disabilities. 
Working with a retained accessibility consultant, we will be implementing over time the relevant portions for public's Accessibility.
Our website will be tested on a periodic basis with assistive technology such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, 
and with users with disabilities who use these technologies. 
Please be aware that our efforts are ongoing.
If, at any time, you have specific questions or concerns about the accessibility of any particular Web page on our website, please contact us at info@bakeforusbakery.com.
If you do encounter an accessibility issue, we will do our best to assist you.</p>
